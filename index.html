  <p class=indent>
    Who knows where this website will go or what it will look like in a few weeks, months, or years. But so far I know I don't give a shit and don't expect it to become all <em>that</em> much.
    Although a humble beginning, hopefully I'll be more or less a front end web developer making OK money in maybe 4-6 months time. As long as I don't fall into the pit of apathy, I should be good.
    Only time will tell.

      <li>Tech training that got me ready for being a satellite communications technician. Honestly not as hard as you might think, they design these courses so the biggest idiot will
        be able to follow simple instructions. Nevertheless, you'd be surprised how dumb some people can be..</li>
