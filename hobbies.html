          Played games my whole life. My earliest memories involve games mostly because my older brothers were into them and we were always moving, so without a stable set of friends as I grew up I
          ended up playing a lot of games in my time and it's translated all the way til now. Sometimes I regret it, but they still remain an entertainment medium I enjoy because I constantly am
          engaged that way, as opposed to just vegging out and absorbing whatever shit gets displayed on TV nowadays.

          My dad made me learn an instrument when I was 12, mostly because I had no real hobbies or extracurricular activities. I was resentful of the idea at first, I didn't really wanna do anything.
          I picked it up quickly, though, and after I got into practicing on my own merit, my interest took off. Now it's one of my main hobbies, and I'd be an entirely different person had I not started.
          That I owe to my dad.
